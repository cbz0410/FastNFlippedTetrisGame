# FastNFlippedTetrisGame

Using my reverse-engineered Tetris game, I created an original spin: Fast N' Flipped Tetris

In this world, gravity has suddenly inverted, and now the classic pieces of Tetrominoes fly upwards! Complete 20 lines as fast as possible with inverted controls to win the game and reverse gravity to its normal state.

 In this project, I expanded on my knowledge learned in the Tetris project, including:
-  More efficient and precise moving mechanisms to handle more complex user input
-  A time tracking system that implements across different scenes, showing the user their time on the win screen
-  UI alterations and the intermingling between scripting and UI
-  Working with Tilemaps and Grids
-  Step functions and object movement with user input

The most important skills that I strengthened were:

- Scripting
- Debugging
- Game Logic
- Utilizing Unity's built-in features
- Handling input from the keyboard and movement
